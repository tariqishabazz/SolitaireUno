# SolitaireUno

A Python version of my Java Card Game of SolitaireUno
A simplified, turn-based version of Uno with descending rules. 
Players will be dealt 10 cards.
They must then place a card in descending order based on the card currently visible.
Watch out for that pesky Queen of Spades!

Whoever plays all their cards wins
